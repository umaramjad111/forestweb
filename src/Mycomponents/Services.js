            especially when some have clearer dollar values than others. However, Canadians increasingly recognize the many ecosystem 
            services that forests provide, and resource agencies are starting to assess and estimate forests’ economic, social and 
            environmental values. At the same time, forests also store carbon, preserve soils and nurture a diversity of species. 
            These non-timber benefits are known as
             “ecosystem services.” The benefits provided by forest ecosystems include:

goods such as timber, food, fuel and bioproducts
ecological functions such as carbon storage, nutrient cycling, water and air purification, and maintenance of wildlife habitat
social and cultural benefits such as recreation, traditional resource uses and spirituality. The primary challenge for sustainable forest management is finding ways to continue to benefit from ecological services without compromising the forest’s ability to provide those services.</p>
